## 1. Context
You are a fullstack developer creating an app for a project. You are creating a minimal todo app from scratch that enables managing tasks
- **Stack:** React, TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB.

## 2. Requirements
- Users can add, remove and edit todo items.
- Items are persisted locally for each browser
- Items contain name, description, due date and ‘done’ checkmark
- Items must be validated (title min 4 chars, max 100. Description - min 0, max 500).

## 3. Technical Constraints
- **Database:** Enable both a local DB and a DB using MongoDB
- **Styling:**  Use Tailwind CSS.
- **Testing:** Test the functionality of each unit of code. 
- The app is created from nothing, so all dependencies must be installed
## 4. Anti-Patterns (What NOT to do)
Do not create random explanation files.

## 5. Output Format
Generate code for frontend and backend. Make sure to create an asset for the main screen and the items display so they can later be extended as needed. In addition, make a DB in the backend and a router.
Make sure that the project can be easily installed on any device using the relevant package managers.
